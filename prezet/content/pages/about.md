I'm **Francisco Barrento**, Staff Software Engineer and Tech Lead at AXOGROUP, where I lead development on [**uScore**](https://uscore.no/)—a Nordic personal finance platform helping users optimize loans, understand credit scores, and make smarter financial decisions.

My focus is on building robust, testable systems with Laravel, Inertia (Vue + React), Filament and Pest to build seamless monolithic applications. I'm exploring and particularly interested in integrating AI into development workflows in ways that enhance—not replace—team collaboration.

Through [PhpDevKits](https://github.com/PhpDevKits) and [PhpMCP](https://github.com/PhpMCP), I create open-source SDKs and MCP servers for underserved services, starting with the Ortto Laravel SDK.

Father of two, dog owner, occasional horse riding supervisor. I share what I learn to contribute back to the community.
