About Me

# Hello, my name is Francisco Barrento.

I'm a Staff Software Engineer and Tech Lead at [AxoGroup](https://axogroup.com), where I work on [uScore](https://uscore.no)—a personal finance platform helping people across the Nordics make smarter financial decisions.

I build applications with Laravel, Inertia (Vue + React), Filament and Pest. I love creating open-source tools through [**PhpDevKits**](https://github.com/phpdevkits) and [**PhpMCP**](https://github.com/phpmcp)—SDKs and MCP servers for services that deserve better developer support.

I live in Portugal with my two amazing daughters, **Catarina** (18, studying tourism at university) and **Beatriz** (13, the horse-crazy one). We also have Kika, our 12-year-old dog, and Trevo, our 2-year-old horse who's still learning the ropes.

I'm fairly online, you can find me:
* sharing code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fbarrento)
* being professional on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-barrento/)
* tweeting on [X](https://x.com/fbarrento)
* having conversations on [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/@fbarrento)
